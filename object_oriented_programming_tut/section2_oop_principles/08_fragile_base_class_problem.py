# The Fragile Base Class Problem is a situation in object-oriented programming where changes to a base class can 
# inadvertently break derived classes. This occurs when derived classes rely on specific behaviors or 
# implementations of the base class that are not explicitly defined in the interface. This is due to tight coupling.

# Key Points about the Fragile Base Class Problem:
# 1: Inheritance coupling
# 2: Ripple effect: changing behavior in base class affects derived classes, requires regression testing of code changes.
# 3: Limited extensibility: fear of making changes to avoid breaking the software.
# 4: Brittle Software: minor changes to one part of code can lead to unexpected failures in other parts.
# 5: Mitigation Strategies: Use SOLID principles to mitigate the Fragile Base Class Problem.
